Description: This package includes 18 calibrated equations to estimate the monthly 
    rainfall erosivity (El30m) in different locations in Brazil, obtained through 
    a literature review. These equations enable the estimation of rainfall erosivity 
    using data from pluviometric stations. Additionally, this package encompasses 
    the formula for the rainfall coefficient (RC) and annual erosivity (El30).
